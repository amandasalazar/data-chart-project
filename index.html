    <div class="container text">
      <p>Families and couples stream in through glass doors, eager to be seated. Waitstaff buzz about the main dining room, platters of sizzling food in hand. Cakes and pies sit in wide display cases, while a bar is stacked high with bottles of all kinds of liquor.</p>
      <p>This is the scene at the Floridian Plaza Diner, a new but not-so-new restaurant that opened in late September on the border of the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Marine Park and Old Mill Basin.</p>
      <p>Having been around since the ‘60s, the diner first opened under the name of The New Floridian Diner. Located on Flatbush Avenue near Kings Plaza Mall, the diner was where shoppers would stop for dinner and a spot for young people during the late hours.</p>
      <p>Flash forward to now, the diner is reopening from a pandemic shutdown, has changed owners and has an entirely new staff.</p>
      <p>The menu — which one customer joked is “900 pages” due to its length — was also redesigned, though the items remain nearly the same.</p>
      <p>It’s largely comprised of American fare, such as burgers, wraps and finger foods, but also includes a breakfast menu and some Greek cuisine in a nod to the founder’s heritage. Founder and longtime owner Dimitrios Kaloidis died in Greece in September 2019.</p>
      <p>The entire restaurant has been redone, from the signs in the parking lot all the way to the kitchen.</p>
      <p>Instead of the mirrored walls and dated booths that customers used to be greeted with, the diner is now modernly decorated. The walls are an earthy beige, the countertops are grey marble and frosted glass dividers separate the booths.</p>
      <p>“There’s only one thing that hasn’t changed — this plant,” customer Jack Steinweis said, gesturing to the plastic potted plant beside his booth. Steinweis frequented the diner during the late ‘60s and early ‘70s.</p>
      <p>The Floridian is just one example of the many New York City restaurants that closed down during the pandemic — and one of the few that have reopened.</p>

      <p>According to the Office of the New York State Comptroller, New York City’s restaurant industry provided 317,800 jobs in 2019. In 2021, that number was 148,100. An estimated 10% of city food businesses closed at one point or another since the start of the pandemic, according to New York City Small Business Services.</p>
      <p>“Any business reopening now after the pandemic could expect some challenges as the economy has changed in many key aspects,” SBS spokesperson Josh Jamieson said.</p>
      <p>During 2020, the Floridian shut down with no word as to whether it would reopen at any time. It never offered takeout or outdoor dining</p>
      <p>Behind the scenes, though, things were happening. Steve Osman bought the diner in spring 2021. The diner underwent a full renovation, and a whole new staff was hired and trained ahead of the trial reopening.</p>
      <p>General manager Adam Sharaf said the diner is considering its current opening to be a trial period until the staff gets settled. Once the diner opens “officially” in a few months, it will return to its former 24-hour schedule. Current hours are 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>
      <p>Training took more than a month, Sharaf said. One of the new staff members he trained is hostess India Faulcon. She said the loyalty of the regulars stands out to her.</p>
      <p>“What’s the most unique about it is that, even despite all the years it’s been closed or the months it’s been closed, the same faces from previous years still come back in and are still excited to come back,” she said.</p>
      <p>Brenda Hertzendorf is an example of that. The Marine Park resident was a regular of the diner before its closing and has eaten at the diner at least five times since its reopening.</p>
      <p>“The décor is really nice, they really fixed it up very nicely. It’s comfortable, and they’re very accommodating,” she said. “We like the whole atmosphere.”</p>
      <p>The diner has seen more than 200 customers per day since its reopening, Sharaf said. He shared the key to bringing a restaurant back from the pandemic.</p>
      <p>“Know your customer well, know what he is eating, know his name,” he said. “Treat him well. Let him leave the place happy. That’s it.”</p>
